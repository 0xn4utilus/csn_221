// 8 registers are implemented using array of 32 bits variable name will be reg[n] 
// mux as ternary operators.
// flag involved in hazard for each register will be named as regFlag[n] and will be implemented as a single bit element array
// variables -> input-> clk, index(index of register), reset,  rs, rt, rd , val_to_write,
